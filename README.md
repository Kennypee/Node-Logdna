Welcome to the Manifold Quickstart!
===================================

This project implements our [quickstart](https://docs.manifold.co/docs/quickstart-6G2IZEjhD20oK6iISoQOE6) guide which walks you through provisioning a LogDNA resource and starting to log to the dashboard.

Getting Started:
- [Remix](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/manifold-quickstart) this app.
- Provision a LogDNA resource (it's free!) through your Manifold account and add the `KEY` credential to your `.env` file.
